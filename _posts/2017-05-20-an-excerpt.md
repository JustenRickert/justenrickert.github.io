There are laws to argument. There exist laws in the fabric of the universe
that people are always meant to be trying to figure out. The syntax of
conversation encodes the laws somehow. As a blur at first, but then through
repetition becomes clear. It is through reiteration, a practicing of the
scenarios in our minds, then a rearrangement of the possibilities of what
could have happened that makes what we think important. It is by a sort of
argument that we understand better the laws of argument; circularly we argue
the laws which turn around our thoughts and causes us to improve the laws we
initially set our gaze upon to argue. Perhaps that is the purpose of
existence. To figure out this argument. To see the laws in the fabric of our
daily lives and to decide that there needs to be something common in our
group understanding of the event, then needing a denotation of it according
which reestablishes the laws in a way better suited to making apparent the
initial individual comprehension of the law. We find words to say what we
mean, but only when we see that there is something we mean to say.

To the original man, it was an inspiration of some kind. He found that the
force of his proceedings, his hand striking together rocks, caused the rocks
to break. It was a conversation through argument. Firstly, the rock argued it
could not be broken, where the man saw that his strength was great and so
begged to differ. Then the rock argued it could not be useful; it could not
be sharp. As the man cuts his hand on the newly found sharp edge of the rock,
it becomes clear to him that the rock's apparent lack of fragility was only
meant to make the man repudiate his actions. In this state, the existence of
the sharp utensil purports the universe wants only to hurt the man who
endeavored to dispute the original meaning of the rock's existence. Just as
the man endeavored previously, he will continue. As such the argument will go
on according with the man's own dissatisfaction with the universe.

I believe this arguing to be
a
[sort of mathematics]({% post_url 2017-05-23-mystical-mathematical-argument %})
that we are always trying to better. It is something that should have been
perfect as the viewport in front of us, mathematics, that when found to be
imperfect lead us to try to correct it. That is because this sort of mathematics
should have been correct and verifiable (such is this definition of
mathematics). It is a contradiction to say that the mathematics consisting of
true statements leads one to formulation of one of the statements as false. Were
it not for the contradiction, however, the laws of mathematics would be
inconsistent in that it did not contain the contradiction, but were it not for
the contradiction nobody would attempt to argue better the laws of argument. And
so it goes.

The best minds say that there is only time to limit the things able to be
accomplished, and so it should be this amount of time to limit what it is
exactly that people /want/ to accomplish. Through this idea we consider how it
was that people were affected through time by human circumstances. In the
primordial moments, people argued the laws to decide the commonalities of
utterances. People determined a language. How does someone sound confused
compared to enlightened for example, or how does one sound happy as opposed
to sad? What kind of noise should be made by the mouth to transmit the
appurtenances of one's sensations? Following this idea, there must surely
must be agreement on the sides of both parties according to each of their
personal experiences. But how could only a vocalization transmit such an
abstract concept that is found so commonly between them? This must be a law
of an argument asking to be argued. It is a principle of the process of
conversation asking to be made worthy to ensure membership to the set of
axiomatic principles of regular conversational statements.
