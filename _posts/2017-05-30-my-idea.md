I'm going to start off by going through a brief history of my experiences using
the Internet and social media. I will attempt to detail the parts of it that are
important. Then I'm going to present an idea related to the history and the
important parts.

Myspace
-------

Myspace is a social networking website founded in 2003. Apparently it existed in
a previous state as an online data storage/sharing site, and considered
originally requiring a fee for the basic Myspace services. In that year I was 9
years old, and it wasn't until a couple years afterwards that I made a profile
(though it wasn't until _much_ later that I actually started using the site
frequently). When I first made my account, I remember Tom from Myspace sitting
in my friend requests and scaring me away. It bewildered me that some random guy
found my profile so quickly after making it, and, not knowing anything about it,
promptly stopped even considering using the site for a while.

</div>

At that point I only used the computer to play Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne
custom games and talk to childhood friends on MSN Messenger after school. I
never ventured far into the Internet back then. Mostly it was a place for
finding video game guides and cheat codes, though not soon later it was for
pirating all the things: games, music, and eventually video editing software (I
wanted to be a YouTube celebrity when I was younger, but maybe I'll get to that
eventually in a different blog post). As a youngster it wasn't actually that the
Internet ever brought me to finding a community of people with common interests.
Even when there were social media websites, I don't feel I ever participated in
creating any media. Information stolen from the Internet led me to enjoy the
things that I did, but it was entirely a personal experience.

When I actually got around to using Myspace, attempted to socialize with my
contemporaries, the cool thing was having a unique profile page. It was
interesting back then how customized the pages could be. (I can't remember if
one could use external resources to manipulate the page or what, but most pages
perplexed me as I didn't understand how _my_ page looked so basic compared to
other peoples'). However, having to navigate all the different varieties of
pages became cumbersome. Some people put music on the page that nobody could
mute, whereas other people made their pages so sparse that it eliminated most of
the interesting content to look at. Since people made the contents of their
pages was unique, there was no way to know where to look to find something
specific and furthermore no way to validate whether something was on the page or
not. The user personalized himself, but eliminated his content; for me it wasn't
ever an experience to actually socialize.

I think this was ultimately the fall of Myspace. Around this time I began
experimenting with other sites. Mostly I was following my friends around who
wanted to go to other places; social media didn't really mean a lot to me at the
time --- I was still playing a lot of Warcraft --- so it was arbitrary where I
made my next profile.

Facebook
--------

</div>

When Facebook came around, I think it was the lack of customization that
actually made it more popular than Myspace. Myspace wasn't really a place to
share with friends, it was a place to share the different possible ways to make
default pages. Later, as Facebook was implementing cover photos, I remember
people lamenting that the reason they moved to Facebook was because they didn't
want to have to endlessly tweak their profiles like they had to with Myspace.
Other than that it was a place to communicate with each other, and to share
content about their lives --- it was a place to socialize.

</div>

In all honesty, both places, Myspace and Facebook, are terrible at communication
compared to other platforms like Discord, Slack, Gitter, or even IRC --- though
those services are just simply trying to fulfill a different purpose. In any
case Facebook took the reigns on social media, making the Internet a place to
share the content of one's life with a ubiquitous platform. One could post
something and get feedback from friends who could either like or comment on it.
That's still pretty much all that Facebook did and still does.

Facebook allows people to share comments, pictures, news, organization profiles,
etc. People often host events through Facebook, and there are groups people can
create for specific topics. I've always used Facebook for its messaging services
(though not good, it's ubiquitous among my peers), and the developers at
Facebook are always slowly implementing new features into the messaging service
that make it constantly nicer to talk to people. Thinking back, I think Myspace
did all of this too, but I could be wrong about that. Regardless, it must have
been the ubiquitous nature of Facebook profiles making it more popular. Every
page is a stream of content produced by the people one wants to see, and the
content will be the same for every person who comes across it. For me, however,
the streams of content never seemed to contain anything that interested me. I
still scoured the Internet to steal information from it, never contributing.

Now, however, emerging sites operating with the idea to stream only
personalized, relevant content exist. One such example is Reddit.

Reddit
------

<div class="right">

</div>

As people tire of Facebook, places like Reddit become more popular. I've been a
frequent Reddit lurker for probably years now. It has a great model for
containing like-minded individuals. Communities of people exist within
subreddits, and every subreddit looks the same. It is a ubiquitous experience,
and it seems people still find that enjoyable. Reddit, by itself however, does
not actually host any content. It links to content elsewhere on the Internet.
This is fantastic design, as Reddit then doesn't need to figure out how to host
the different kinds of content. Reddit relies on a culture of anonymity,
however, so those who post content most often don't matter. Also, it is frowned
upon to post one's own creations. Self promotion leads to undesired content as
usually poor content creators are more numerous than good ones. In this way,
everyone posts content which is not their own, creators cannot make claim to the
content they create, and the base of users further remains anonymous.

My idea
-------

The Internet is a wonderful place for sharing content, and people like to find
themselves attached to a ubiquitous experience. I have always used the Internet
to learn about and enjoy content, though, in my case, there is no social media
website which has ever brought me to finding a community of people whom I've
felt common among. Either the content didn't match what I desired, or I couldn't
exist in the community other than being an anonymous voice (meaning I couldn't
have a real, social experience).

- __Myspace__
  - _No ubiquity_
  - _No content or just not a lot of content_

Myspace provided an experience allowing people to be unique through page
customization, but this often led to the elimination of content and I don't
remember ever having the streams of content as in more contemporary websites.

- __Facebook__
  - _Ubiquity_
  - _Content attached to self, but limited by what Facebook can hold and by the
    interests of friends_

Facebook gives a ubiquitous platform for sharing content, though the content is
only deliverable to a small community of people who probably do not care about
it.

- __Reddit__
  - _Ubiquity_
  - _Links to content of limitless scope available on the Internet, but not
    attached to self_

Reddit provides ubiquitous subreddit containers for desirable content, but
personal attachment to content is impossible; it does not provide a social
experience.

- __Idea__
  - _Ubiquity_
  - _Content of limitless scope, but also attached to self_

There should be a social media platform containing streams of quality
information, where people can contribute to the content and attach themselves to
the creations they provide. It should provide a social experience where anyone
can contribute, yet remain democratic in a way to entertain only the most
interesting content.
