Check out this video if you're interested. It's pretty long, but I think gives a
pretty good starting point for the mood of this post. It isn't necessary to
watch. I just want to share it.

The video to me demonstrates the ability language has as a meaningful tool to
describe real-world scenarios. There is an important statement in the field of
linguistics which, in reference to a language's ability to explicate, is a
perfectly fine sentence fragment but purports no real-world scenario. The
statement is

> colorless green ideas sleep furiously,

and I wish now to give some semantic definition to it.

Upon first glance, it would seem that the statement is nonsensical. The
statement was formulated by Noam Chomsky to demonstrate a generative grammar
producing a category mistake. It is a statement perfectly grammatical, yet
supposedly unfounded in the natural world. The following is a derivation of the
sentence in such a way hoping to give proper semantic meaning to the statement,
signifying the statement as grammatically and semantically correct.

Firstly consider the statement in two separations, the first a noun phrase
consisting of _colorless green ideas_, the second a verb phrase _sleep
furiously_. We will start with the second part, then move on to the first part,
in the end reassembling the two separations.

To Sleep Furiously
------------------

Let's start with the verb phrase. What does it mean to sleep furiously? To do
anything furiously means one of two things according to the definition of
furiously.

{% include definition.html
word="fu·ri·ous·ly"
ipa="ˈfyo͞orēəslē"
part="adverb"
content="In an extremely angry manner." 
content2="In an extremely energetic or hurried manner; intensely."%}

Either the thing is done in an extremely angry manner, or the thing is done
extremely hurriedly or intensely such that it will have appeared to be done with
an unnaturally large amount of energy. By either definition, meaning can be
given to the verb phrase _to sleep furiously_.

In consideration of the first definition, let there exist a child furious over
the rules set by his parents about going to bed at a certain hour. In this case,
imagine that the child is in the middle of doing something he believes to be
important, where all of a sudden the clock displays a certain time so that his
parents interrupt his progress and tell him he needs to go to bed. The child
wants nothing else but to finish the work he's started. He begins to see his
motivation crumbling before his eyes. How could he possibly ever again find the
determination he's set for himself to finish this project? Tears begin to well
up in his eyes. He begins to yell emotionally about it. He cannot stand that his
own parents would make him feel this way when it should have been obvious to
them how passionate he had become over the project. Now he must angrily retreat
to his room, where for many moments he will lie awake before drifting to sleep
furiously.

In consideration of the second definition of the word furiously, let the same
furious child exist as before under the same conditions, this time with the
additional consideration that the child is working _in his room_ on the project.
Before being told that he will need to go to bed, the child decides to try
outsmarting his parents. He hatches a plan to pretend to already be fast asleep
when his parents enter the room. As he hears his parents make their way almost
to the barrier of his domain, he energetically traverses his quarters attempting
to thwart the enemy of his parents seeking to witness his transgressions. He
makes his way onto his bed covered in blankets and pillows. In a hurried manner
he throws the covers over the top of his body and intensely pretends to lie
unconscious as his parents open the door. Upon entering, they witness nothing
but the body of their child secretly sleeping furiously.

Colorless Green Ideas
---------------------

The noun phrase in the question is a little harder to put an exact epistemic
rationalization to. In philosophy there are several definitions given to the
word _idea_:

{% include definition.html
word="i·de·a"
ipa="īˈdēə"
part="noun (philosophy)"
content="an eternally existing pattern of which individual things in any class are imperfect copies."
content2="a concept of pure reason, not empirically based in experience." %}

Since we are looking to make sense of the phrase in consideration of naturally
occurring phenomena, it is fair to throw out the second definition being that it
contradicts the point we are trying to prove. In light of this, the first
definition becomes more desirable. It is an _existing pattern_. Considering the
definition of idea from a less philosophical point of view, we attain something
less close to something patterned but more abstract. It is:

{% include definition.html
word="i·de·a"
ipa="īˈdēə"
part="noun"
content="a concept or mental impression." %}

It is something expressible by words though not entirely, and exists prior to
the words existing; something causally formulated by human consciousness and
surreal (not existing in concrete form). In consideration of this, it does not
make sense that an idea is green. Though, from a surreal perspective, people
still attribute abstract meaning sometimes to the adjective green. If one forms
the sense of green to mean _go_ in the same way that modern people associate the
green signals at stoplights to me _go_, then green might be attachable to such a
condition the same as the moving word _go_. A green idea could be an idea
intended to be or do something at the point one calls something going, similar
to stoplights signaling cars to move upon changing color.

Putting Them Together
---------------------

Again considering the furious child who schemed to outwit his parents, it seems
plausible to say that the child's enemy initiated his cunning idea. Let's say
that it was not this intention of the enemy, however, that intended the moving
of the scheme. Rather let us say that the child's ideas are things already in
motion to be suddenly halted by the child's parents' initiation. They were grand
ideas on a trajectory of completion, then suddenly laid to rest.

In the haste of it all, the child had to furiously place his eyelids shut,
leaving his ideas uncompleted. The ideas are left like an unfinished coloring
book looking scribbled upon next to crayons on the ground. In the mind of the
child put to bed, the ideas are outlines of things started but unfortunately
amounting to nothing in the end. His colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
