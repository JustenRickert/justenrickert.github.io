Hello! I call myself Mathematician and Web Developer and aspire to make an
important impact on the World Wide Web. If you're interested in what I've
already done, check out these lists of things. Also please make sure to check
back in sometime!

### Current Works

* Clojure commodities market simulation concept
  ([repository](https://github.com/JustenRickert/commodigame), [prototype]({{
  site.baseurl }}/commodigame/)). Eventually want to create a fun incremental
  game for people to play, including an as large as possible set of commodities
  as well as achievements, a server-run market of varying commodities to
  influence markets, and potentially a global leaderboard.

* Personal finance application concept
  ([repository](https://github.com/JustenRickert/financial-tribble),
  [prototype]({{ site.baseurl }}/finapp/)). Idea is to
  allow user to add collections of recurring payments, then using that to
  reactively graph expected overall balances below. Eventually want to allow
  input of individual payments, then using an interpolating function to guess
  the recurring payments. Uses React/Redux, and Recharts.

* Open world JavaScript video game concept
  ([repository](https://github.com/JustenRickert/didactic-octo-waffle)).
  Currently have implemented basic controls and a camera/scene to follow the
  character around the map. Utilizes React and PIXI.
